Serverless Face Detection App with React, Node.js, and AWS
Overview
This repository contains the source code for a serverless face detection application built using React, Node.js, and various AWS services. The application captures images from a webcam, uploads them to AWS S3, triggers a Lambda function for face recognition using Rekognition, and stores the results in DynamoDB.
